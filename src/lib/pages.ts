 * it: the page itself (for its stylesheets, body class and SEO), and the root
 * layout — which has to put the WordPress body class on `<body>` and therefore
 * needs to resolve a page from a URL rather than from a route param.
 *
 * `/en-in/` and `/en-ae/` are the two market home pages and keep their own
 * entries; every other key is a shared page rendered under whichever market the
 * visitor is in.
