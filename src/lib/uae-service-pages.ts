/**
 * PageConfigs for the UAE services section.
 *
 * Every other page has a hand-transcribed entry in data/page-configs.json,
 * because every other page was a real WordPress page with a real `$PAGE`
 * declaration behind it. These are not: the six UAE services and the twenty-nine
 * pages beneath them are new, they all render the same three sections, and the
 * only thing that differs between them is a name and a URL. Thirty-five
 * near-identical JSON blocks would be thirty-five places for one of them to
 * drift, so they are derived from vxnServices('en-ae') instead — the same
 * registry the header menu and the UAE home page already read.
 *
 * The shape is copied from the /community/ entry, which is the other
 * "hero image, coming soon, subscribe" page in the registry: header 3837,
 * footer 2094, and the 3752 (single page) + 4557 (subscribe) stylesheets that
 * PageHeroSection and SubscribeSection need.
